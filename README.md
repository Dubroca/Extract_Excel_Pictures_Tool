# Extract_Excel_Pictures_Tool


This tool allows several things:
- Extract all the images from an uploaded Excel file and rename them with the information in the columns.
- Put them in a zip file and download it for the user.
- Convert the Excel file into a csv file either in American format separated by a comma or in European format separated by a semicolon.
- Make various modifications to the csv file created (deleting columns, unwanted characters, adding columns by concatenating two others...).
